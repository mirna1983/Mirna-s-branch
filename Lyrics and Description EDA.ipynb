    "\n",
    "A: If we left stopwords in the data, the \"top 5 words\" would likely be common stopwords such as \"the,\" \"and,\" \"a,\" \"to,\" and \"in.\" These words are frequently used in the English language and would dominate the list of most common words, overshadowing more meaningful and distinctive words that better represent the content of the lyrics or tweets. Removing stopwords helps to highlight the words that carry more significant meaning and provide better insights into the themes and topics discussed by the artists.\n",

    "\n",
    "A: I initially believed that different artists would exhibit varying levels of lexical diversity based on their styles and genres. For instance, I expected a more lyrically complex artist to have higher lexical diversity than a pop artist. The actual analysis might confirm this expectation if there is a significant difference, or it might show that both artists use a similar range of vocabulary. This insight helps to understand their unique linguistic styles and audience engagement.\n"
